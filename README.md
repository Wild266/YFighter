# YFighter

## Welcome to Yeet Fighter!

### Requirements

Setup Java 7
```Ensure that importing javax.swing.*; works
Ensure that importing javax.io.*; works
Ensure that importing sun.audio.*; works
Ensure that importing javax.sound.sampled.*; works
```
This is a two-player fighter game. To run the game, please download the repository as a Zip file, unzip it and run Driver.java

If everything works, there may be some green text for errors as the library sun.audio loads the music file, but these should go away soon.
