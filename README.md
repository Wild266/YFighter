# YFighter

## Welcome to Yeet Fighter!

### Requirements

Setup Java 7
```
Ensure that importing javax.swing.*; works
Ensure that importing javax.io.*; works
Ensure that importing sun.audio.*; works
Ensure that importing javax.sound.sampled.*; works
```
This is a two-player fighter game. To run the game, please download the repository as a Zip file, unzip it and run Driver.java

If everything works, there may be some green text for errors as the library sun.audio loads the music file, but these should go away soon.

When running the file, you should see this screen if the packages are installed correctly:

To continue, simply press any key on the standard English keyboard.

You should get to a screen that looks like this:

There are two players on the screen depicted by red and cyan squares. The white line on the bottom is known as the platform.

This is the start of the game. The player who wants to use the cyan block can use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move.
